# Task Allocation Backend Implementation

## Overview

This document describes the backend implementation for task allocation functionality in the Teleops system. The implementation allows tasks to be allocated to vendors or internal teams with comprehensive tracking, timeline management, and automatic status updates.

## ✅ **FULLY IMPLEMENTED FEATURES:**

### 1. **Automatic Task Status Updates**

- **Vendor Allocation**: Task status automatically changes to `'allocated'`
- **Internal Team Assignment**: Task status automatically changes to `'assigned'`
- **Work Started**: Task status automatically changes to `'in_progress'`
- **Work Completed**: Task status automatically changes to `'completed'`
- **Allocation Cancelled**: Task status reverts to `'pending'`

### 2. **Comprehensive Task Timeline**

- **Task Creation**: Timeline event when task is created
- **Allocation Events**: Timeline events for vendor/team allocation
- **Status Changes**: Timeline events for all status transitions
- **Progress Updates**: Timeline events for progress changes
- **Comments**: Timeline events when comments are added
- **Equipment Verification**: Timeline events for equipment verification
- **Work Lifecycle**: Start, progress, completion timeline events

### 3. **Sub-Activity Support**

- Individual sub-activity allocation tracking
- Progress tracking per sub-activity
- Status management at sub-activity level

## Models

### 1. TaskAllocation

The main model for tracking task allocations to vendors or internal teams.

**Key Fields:**

- `task`: ForeignKey to Task model
- `allocation_type`: Either 'vendor' or 'internal_team'
- `vendor_relationship`: ForeignKey to ClientVendorRelationship (for vendor allocations)
- `internal_team`: ForeignKey to Team (for internal team allocations)
- `allocated_sub_activities`: Many-to-many relationship with TaskSubActivity
- `status`: Allocation status (allocated, in_progress, completed, cancelled, reallocated)
- `allocated_by`: User who created the allocation
- `updated_by`: User who last updated the allocation

**Validation:**

- Cannot have both vendor_relationship and internal_team
- Must have vendor_relationship for vendor allocations
- Must have internal_team for internal team allocations

### 2. TaskSubActivityAllocation

Intermediate model for managing sub-activity allocations with additional metadata.

**Key Fields:**

- `allocation`: ForeignKey to TaskAllocation
- `sub_activity`: ForeignKey to TaskSubActivity
- `status`: Individual sub-activity status
- `progress_percentage`: Progress tracking (0-100)
- `estimated_duration_hours`: Estimated time for completion
- `actual_duration_hours`: Actual time taken

### 3. TaskAllocationHistory

Audit trail for tracking all changes to task allocations.

**Key Fields:**

- `allocation`: ForeignKey to TaskAllocation
- `action`: Type of change (created, updated, status_changed, etc.)
- `previous_status`: Status before change
- `new_status`: Status after change
- `changed_by`: User who made the change
- `change_reason`: Reason for the change

### 4. TaskTimeline ⭐ **NEW**

Comprehensive timeline tracking for all task lifecycle events.

**Key Fields:**

- `task`: ForeignKey to Task model
- `event_type`: Type of timeline event (created, allocated, assigned, work_started, etc.)
- `event_data`: JSON field storing relevant event information
- `timestamp`: When the event occurred
- `user`: User who triggered the event

**Event Types:**

- `created`: Task was created
- `allocated`: Task was allocated to vendor
- `assigned`: Task was assigned to internal team
- `work_started`: Work on task was started
- `work_completed`: Work on task was completed
- `cancelled`: Task was cancelled
- `reallocated`: Task was reallocated
- `status_changed`: Task status was changed
- `progress_updated`: Task progress was updated
- `comment_added`: Comment was added to task
- `equipment_verified`: Equipment was verified

Serializer for updating allocations with change tracking.

### TaskSubActivityAllocationSerializer

Serializer for sub-activity allocation data.

### TaskAllocationHistorySerializer

Serializer for allocation history records.

### TaskTimelineSerializer ⭐ **NEW**

Serializer for timeline events with human-readable descriptions.

## Business Logic

### Allocation Creation with Status Updates ⭐ **ENHANCED**

1. Validate allocation data (type, vendor/team, sub-activities)
2. Create main allocation record
3. Create sub-activity allocation records
4. **Automatically update task status**:
   - Vendor allocation → `'allocated'`
   - Internal team assignment → `'assigned'`
5. **Create timeline event** for status change
6. Create history record for audit trail

### Status Management with Timeline ⭐ **ENHANCED**

- **allocated**: Initial state after vendor allocation
- **assigned**: Initial state after internal team assignment
- **in_progress**: When work begins (with timeline event)
- **completed**: When work is finished (with timeline event)
- **cancelled**: When allocation is cancelled (with timeline event)
- **reallocated**: When task is reallocated to different vendor/team

### Progress Tracking with Timeline ⭐ **ENHANCED**

- Sub-activities can have individual progress percentages
- Status automatically updates based on progress
- Started/completed timestamps are tracked
- **Timeline events created for all progress updates**

### Timeline Event Creation ⭐ **NEW**

Timeline events are automatically created for:

- Task creation
- Status changes
- Progress updates
- Comments added
- Equipment verification
- Allocation lifecycle events

## Security & Permissions

- Uses existing permission system (TenantScopedPermission)
- Users can only access allocations within their tenant scope
- Audit trail tracks all changes with user information
- Timeline events include user context for accountability

## Performance Considerations

- Uses `select_related` and `prefetch_related` for efficient queries
- Database indexes on frequently queried fields
- Pagination support for large result sets
- Timeline events are optimized with proper indexing

## Integration Points

### Frontend

- `TaskAllocationService` provides TypeScript interfaces and API methods
- **New timeline methods** for viewing task history
- Supports all CRUD operations and custom actions
- Handles authentication and error management

### Existing Models

- Integrates with existing Task, Project, and Vendor models
- Uses existing ClientVendorRelationship for vendor management
- Leverages existing Team model for internal allocations
- **Seamlessly integrates with existing task workflow**

## Database Migrations

To apply the new models, run:

```bash
python manage.py makemigrations tasks
python manage.py migrate
```

## Testing

The implementation includes comprehensive validation and error handling:

- Model validation ensures data integrity
- Serializer validation prevents invalid API requests
- ViewSet actions include proper error responses
- History tracking provides full audit trail
- **Timeline events provide complete task lifecycle visibility**

## Frontend Integration

### New API Endpoints Available:

```typescript
// Get task timeline
const timeline = await taskAllocationService.getTaskTimeline(taskId);

// Get filtered timeline events
const events = await taskAllocationService.getTimelineEvents({
  task_id: taskId,
  event_type: "status_changed",
});

// Get recent activity
const recentActivity = await taskAllocationService.getRecentActivity(20);
```

### Timeline Event Structure:

```typescript
interface TaskTimelineEvent {
  id: string;
  event_type: 'allocated' | 'assigned' | 'work_started' | 'work_completed' | ...;
  event_data: Record<string, any>; // Relevant event information
  timestamp: string;
  user_name: string;
  event_description: string; // Human-readable description
}
```

## Future Enhancements

1. **Bulk Operations**: Support for allocating multiple tasks at once
2. **Advanced Filtering**: More sophisticated query capabilities
3. **Notification System**: Alerts for allocation changes
4. **Reporting**: Advanced analytics and reporting features
5. **Workflow Integration**: Integration with task workflow systems
6. **Timeline Analytics**: Advanced timeline analysis and reporting
7. **Real-time Updates**: WebSocket support for real-time timeline updates
