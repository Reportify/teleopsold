## Recent Equipment Inventory Updates

### Key Changes to Equipment System (2024-12-28)

1. **Removed Category Constraints**: Equipment is no longer restricted to specific technology categories (2G, MW, 3G). This allows for maximum flexibility and cross-technology equipment usage.

2. **Simplified Equipment Structure**: Eliminated complex category-type hierarchies in favor of a simple equipment name and type structure.

3. **Added Tags System**: Introduced optional tags array for flexible equipment grouping and filtering without rigid constraints.

4. **Optional Templates**: Templates are now guidance tools for quick setup rather than mandatory configurations. Users can mix and match equipment from any source.

5. **Cross-Technology Usage**: Equipment like jumper cables, power cables, and PSU units can now be used across any project type.

### Benefits

- **Flexibility**: Equipment can be used in any project regardless of original categorization
- **Scalability**: Easy addition of new equipment types without schema changes
- **User Experience**: Simplified equipment selection and management
- **Future-Proof**: System supports evolving technology requirements

### Design Phase Clarification

The design phase now focuses exclusively on:

- **Equipment Type Selection**: Identifying WHAT equipment types are needed
- **Technical Specifications**: Defining equipment requirements and specifications
- **Handling Requirements**: Documenting special dismantling requirements
- **Template Application**: Using optional templates for quick equipment type setup

**Quantities and Site Allocations** are handled separately during the inventory management phase, ensuring clear separation of concerns and better workflow organization.
