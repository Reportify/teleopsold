# Circle-Based Architecture: Executive Summary & Recommendation

## Document Information

## üö® **Executive Summary**

Based on your insight that **"Vodafone MPCG and Vodafone UPE behave like different tenants"**, we need to fundamentally redesign our multi-tenant architecture. The current specification treats circles as features within a tenant, but the **business reality** requires circles to operate as **quasi-independent business entities**.

---

## üéØ **The Problem**

### Current Architecture (WRONG)

```
Vodafone Tenant
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ User Management (shared)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Billing (shared)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Vendor Management (shared)
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ Circle Features
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ MPCG operations
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ UPE operations
    ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ Gujarat operations
```

### Business Reality (CORRECT)

```
Vodafone Corporate HQ
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Vodafone MPCG (Independent Business Unit)
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Separate P&L
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Independent employees
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Own vendor contracts
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ Separate billing
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Vodafone UPE (Independent Business Unit)
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Separate P&L
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Independent employees
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Own vendor contracts
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ Separate billing
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ Vodafone Gujarat (Independent Business Unit)
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Separate P&L
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Independent employees
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Own vendor contracts
    ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ Separate billing
```

## üí° **Recommended Solution: Hybrid Circle-Tenant Architecture**

    end

    TELEOPS --> VOD_HQ
    VOD_HQ --> MPCG
    VOD_HQ --> UPE
    VOD_HQ --> GJ

    MPCG --> VENDOR1
    UPE --> VENDOR2
    MPCG --> VENDOR3
    UPE --> VENDOR3
    GJ --> VENDOR3

    style MPCG fill:#ff9999
    style UPE fill:#99ccff
    style GJ fill:#99ff99
    style VOD_HQ fill:#f9f9f9
```

### Implementation Strategy

**1. Circle as Independent Tenants**

- Each circle gets its own tenant ID
- Complete data isolation between circles
- Independent user management, billing, vendor relationships
- Separate subdomains: `vodafone-mpcG.teleops.com`, `vodafone-upe.teleops.com`

**2. Corporate Oversight Capabilities**

- Corporate HQ can view consolidated reports across circles
- Shared master data (equipment categories, etc.)
- Cross-circle analytics and benchmarking
- Unified corporate branding and standards

**3. Vendor Flexibility**

- Vendors can work with single circle or multiple circles
- Each circle-vendor relationship is independent contract
- Separate billing per circle relationship
- Circle-specific performance tracking

---

## üìä **Technical Implementation**

### Database Schema Changes

```sql
-- Enhanced Tenant Hierarchy
CREATE TABLE tenants (
    id UUID PRIMARY KEY,
    tenant_type VARCHAR(30), -- 'Corporate', 'Circle', 'Vendor'
    parent_tenant_id UUID, -- Corporate parent for circles

    -- Circle Information
    circle_code VARCHAR(20), -- 'MPCG', 'UPE', 'GJ'
    circle_name VARCHAR(100),

    -- Independence Flags
    operates_independently BOOLEAN DEFAULT TRUE,
    separate_billing BOOLEAN DEFAULT TRUE,
    independent_vendor_management BOOLEAN DEFAULT TRUE
);

-- All operational tables get circle_tenant_id
ALTER TABLE users ADD COLUMN circle_tenant_id UUID;
ALTER TABLE projects ADD COLUMN circle_tenant_id UUID;
ALTER TABLE sites ADD COLUMN circle_tenant_id UUID;
ALTER TABLE vendor_relationships ADD COLUMN circle_tenant_id UUID;
```

### API Structure

```yaml
Circle-Specific APIs:
  # All operations within circle context
  GET /api/circles/MPCG/users/
  POST /api/circles/MPCG/vendors/invite/
  GET /api/circles/MPCG/billing/

Corporate APIs:
  # Cross-circle reporting and management
  GET /api/corporate/vodafone/circles/
  GET /api/corporate/vodafone/consolidated-billing/

Multi-Circle Operations:
  # For vendors working across circles
  GET /api/vendor/circle-relationships/
  POST /api/vendor/cross-circle-operations/
```

## üí∞ **Business Impact**

### Revenue Model Benefits

**Circle-Specific Billing:**

- Vodafone MPCG: ‚Çπ1.5L/month subscription + usage
- Vodafone UPE: ‚Çπ2L/month subscription + usage
- Vodafone Gujarat: ‚Çπ1.8L/month subscription + usage
- **Total Vodafone Revenue: ‚Çπ5.3L/month** (vs ‚Çπ2L as single tenant)

**Vendor Revenue Multiplication:**

- Same vendor can have contracts with multiple circles
- Each circle relationship = separate subscription
- ABC Vendor: MPCG (‚Çπ50K) + UPE (‚Çπ50K) + Gujarat (‚Çπ50K) = ‚Çπ150K/month

### Operational Benefits

**True Business Alignment:**

- Matches real-world telecom operations
- Proper cost attribution per circle
- Independent vendor negotiations
- Circle-specific performance tracking

**Scalability:**

- Each circle scales independently
- No cross-circle performance impact
- Easier to add new circles
- Better compliance with regulatory requirements

## Vendor Verification Status and Circle-Specific Roles (NEW)

A vendor user can have different verification statuses and permissions in different circles. For each circle-vendor relationship:

- `vendor_verification_status` can be:
  - **Independent**: Not yet verified/contracted; limited access.
  - **Pending_Verification**: Under review by the circle admin.
  - **Verified**: Officially contracted/approved; full operational access.
  - **Verification_Rejected**: Rejected by the circle; access revoked.

This enables the same vendor (and their users) to be a "verified vendor" for one client/circle, but act as an "independent vendor" for another. Permissions, contract terms, and access are managed per circle relationship.

**Example:**

- ABC Vendor is **Verified** in Circle MPCG (full access), **Independent** in Circle UPE (limited access), and **Pending_Verification** in Circle GJ (under review).
