## üìã **Clarified Business Logic**

### **Vendor Onboarding Process**

```yaml
Simplified Onboarding:
  ‚úÖ Standard vendor registration (unchanged)
  ‚úÖ No mention of client associations during onboarding
  ‚úÖ Post-onboarding: Dual-mode client management activated
  ‚úÖ System auto-populates associated clients from vendor_relationships table
```

### **Client Association Detection**

```yaml
Auto-Populated Clients:
  Source: vendor_relationships table
  Management: Read-only, system-managed
  Display: Client name, vendor code, relationship status
  Vendor Access: Cannot edit or duplicate these clients

Independent Client Creation:
  Source: vendor_created_clients table
  Management: Full CRUD operations by vendor
  Validation: Subject to business rules
  Display: Client name, client code, management controls
```

### **Business Validation Rules**

```yaml
Client Duplication Prevention:
  Rule: Exact name matching only
  Logic: Check vendor_relationships.client_tenant_id ‚Üí tenants.organization_name
  Examples: ‚ùå "Vodafone MPCG" ‚Üí Blocked (exact match with associated)
    ‚úÖ "Vodafone UPE" ‚Üí Allowed (different circle)
    ‚úÖ "Vodafone Gujarat" ‚Üí Allowed (different circle)
    ‚úÖ "Airtel UP East" ‚Üí Allowed (not associated)

Multi-Circle Business Rules:
  Corporate Family: Same corporate but different circles allowed
  Circle Independence: Each circle treated as separate entity
  Validation: Only exact name matches are prevented
```

## üñ•Ô∏è **Vendor Portal UI Specification**

### **Separate Sections Layout**

```yaml
Vendor Client Management Dashboard:

üìå Associated Clients Section:
  Display: Auto-populated, read-only list
  Source: vendor_relationships table
  Actions: View only, no edit/delete/add
  Columns:
    - Client Name (from tenants.organization_name)
    - Vendor Code (from vendor_relationships.vendor_code)
    - Relationship Status (from vendor_relationships.relationship_status)
    - Service Areas (from vendor_relationships.service_areas)

‚ûï Independent Clients Section:
  Display: Vendor-managed, full CRUD list
  Source: vendor_created_clients table
  Actions: Add, Edit, Delete, View
  Columns:
    - Client Name (from vendor_created_clients.client_name)
    - Client Code (from vendor_created_clients.client_code)
    - Activity Level (from vendor_created_clients.monthly_activity_level)
    - Management Actions (Edit/Delete/View buttons)

Business Logic Integration:
  Add Client Button:
    - Real-time validation against associated clients
    - Warning for similar names (different circles)
    - Error message for exact matches
    - Success message for valid additions
```

## üîß **Technical Implementation**

### **Database Schema Enhancements**

```sql
-- Client Duplication Prevention Function
CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION validate_vendor_client_name()
RETURNS TRIGGER AS $$
BEGIN
    -- Check exact name match against vendor_relationships
    IF EXISTS (
        SELECT 1 FROM vendor_relationships vr
        JOIN tenants t ON vr.client_tenant_id = t.id
        WHERE vr.vendor_tenant_id = NEW.vendor_tenant_id
        AND LOWER(TRIM(t.organization_name)) = LOWER(TRIM(NEW.client_name))
    ) THEN
        RAISE EXCEPTION 'Client "%" already exists as an associated client. Cannot create as independent client.', NEW.client_name;
    END IF;

    RETURN NEW;
END;
$$ LANGUAGE plpgsql;

-- Trigger for validation
CREATE TRIGGER trigger_validate_vendor_client_name
    BEFORE INSERT OR UPDATE ON vendor_created_clients
    FOR EACH ROW
    EXECUTE FUNCTION validate_vendor_client_name();
```

### **Vendor Portal Client Query**

```sql
-- Complete vendor client portfolio query
SELECT
    'Associated' as client_category,
    t.organization_name as client_name,
    vr.vendor_code,
    vr.relationship_status,
    'Read-Only' as management_type,
    vr.service_areas,
    'System-Managed' as data_source
FROM vendor_relationships vr
JOIN tenants t ON vr.client_tenant_id = t.id
WHERE vr.vendor_tenant_id = :vendor_tenant_id
AND vr.relationship_status = 'Active'

UNION ALL

SELECT
    'Independent' as client_category,
    vc.client_name,
    vc.client_code as vendor_code,
    'Active' as relationship_status,
    'Full CRUD' as management_type,
    ARRAY[]::TEXT[] as service_areas,
    'Vendor-Created' as data_source
FROM vendor_created_clients vc
WHERE vc.vendor_tenant_id = :vendor_tenant_id
AND vc.is_active = TRUE
ORDER BY client_category, client_name;
```

## üìä **Business Scenarios & Examples**

### **Verveland Multi-Client Portfolio Example**

```yaml
Verveland's Complete Client Management:

Vendor Onboarding: ‚úÖ Verveland registers normally (standard vendor registration)
  ‚úÖ No client associations mentioned during registration
  ‚úÖ Onboarding completed successfully

Post-Onboarding Client Management:

üìå Associated Clients (Auto-populated):
  Vodafone MPCG:
    Source: vendor_relationships table
    Management: Read-only (cannot edit/delete)
    Access: Receives projects from Vodafone platform
    Revenue: Free access + premium features

  Jio Gujarat:
    Source: vendor_relationships table
    Management: Read-only (cannot edit/delete)
    Access: Integrated with Jio's workflows
    Revenue: Free access + premium features

‚ûï Independent Clients (Vendor-managed):
  Airtel UP East:
    Source: vendor_created_clients table
    Validation: ‚úÖ Allowed (not in vendor_relationships)
    Management: Full CRUD by Verveland
    Revenue: Verveland pays ‚Çπ8K/month

  BSNL Bihar:
    Source: vendor_created_clients table
    Validation: ‚úÖ Allowed (not in vendor_relationships)
    Management: Full CRUD by Verveland
    Revenue: Verveland pays ‚Çπ6K/month

  Vodafone UPE:
    Source: vendor_created_clients table
    Validation: ‚úÖ Allowed (different circle from Vodafone MPCG)
    Management: Full CRUD by Verveland
    Revenue: Verveland pays ‚Çπ8K/month

Validation Examples: ‚ùå Cannot create "Vodafone MPCG" independently (exact match blocked)
  ‚úÖ Can create "Vodafone UPE" independently (different circle allowed)
  ‚úÖ Can create "Vodafone Gujarat" independently (different circle allowed)
```
