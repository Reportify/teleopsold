# Dual-Mode Vendor Operations - Critical Documentation Update

## Document Information

- **Version**: 1.0
- **Date**: December 2024
- **Purpose**: Document the addition of dual-mode vendor operations capability
- **Status**: Complete - Critical business model feature documented

---

## ðŸŽ¯ **Critical Business Model Enhancement**

### The Missing Capability

**User Insight**: "The vendor can have independent access even if it does not associate with the client. It can create its own client, sites, task and operate independently."

**Business Reality**: Not all telecom operators adopt Teleops simultaneously. Vendors cannot lose business relationships based on their clients' technology adoption status.

**Example Scenario**:

- **Vodafone** uses Teleops (integrated) â†’ Verveland works within Vodafone's platform
- **Airtel** doesn't use Teleops (non-integrated) â†’ Verveland creates "Airtel" as independent client

This dual-mode capability was **completely missing** from the original documentation and represents a critical revenue stream and competitive advantage.
