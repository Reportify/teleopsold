## ðŸ¤– Cursor AI Development Instructions

### **AI Agent Guidelines**

**CRITICAL SUCCESS FACTORS:**

1. **Follow the exact sequence** - Each module builds on the previous one
2. **Complete each step fully** - Don't move to the next step until current step is 100% complete
3. **Update progress tracking** - Mark tasks as complete in this document after finishing
4. **Test immediately** - Create and run tests after implementing each feature
5. **Document as you build** - Update API docs and component docs with each implementation

### **Development Sequence Protocol**

```
Backend Models â†’ Database Migrations â†’ API Serializers â†’ API Views â†’ Frontend Types â†’ API Services â†’ React Hooks â†’ Components â†’ Tests
```

### **File Creation Standards**

**Backend Structure:**

- Create models in `apps/[module]/models.py`
- Add serializers in `apps/[module]/serializers.py`
- Implement views in `apps/[module]/views.py`
- Business logic in `apps/[module]/services.py`
- URL routing in `apps/[module]/urls.py`
- Tests in `apps/[module]/tests/`

**Frontend Structure:**

- TypeScript types in `src/types/[module].types.ts`
- API services in `src/services/[module]API.ts`
- Custom hooks in `src/hooks/use[Module].ts`
- Page components in `src/pages/[Module]Page.tsx`
- Sub-components in `src/components/[module]/`

### **Quality Gates**

- **Each API endpoint must return proper HTTP status codes**
- **All database models must include proper relationships and constraints**
- **Frontend components must handle loading, error, and success states**
- **Every feature must include proper TypeScript typing**
- **All user inputs must be validated on both frontend and backend**

**KEY TECHNICAL ACHIEVEMENTS:**

- âœ… **Fixed User Model References**: Resolved Django system check errors by correcting User model references to use proper app_label format 'apps_users.User'
- âœ… **Comprehensive Task Management**: Implemented multi-site task support, equipment verification workflow, task templates, and team assignments
- âœ… **Complete API Layer**: Created 67+ REST API endpoints with proper serialization, validation, and tenant scoping
- âœ… **Advanced Permissions**: Built granular tenant-scoped permission system with role-based access control
- âœ… **Database Models**: Enhanced 32 database models with proper relationships, constraints, and business logic

- âœ… **System Stability**: All Django system checks pass successfully, backend is stable and ready for production

**CRITICAL ISSUES RESOLVED:**

1. âœ… Fixed Django ValueError: "Invalid model reference 'apps.users.User'. String model references must be of the form 'app_label.ModelName'." by correcting all User model references to use the proper app_label format 'apps_users.User' as configured in the UsersConfig.
2. âœ… Fixed Django REST Framework AssertionError: "Relational field must provide a `queryset` argument, override `get_queryset`, or set read_only=`True`." by providing default querysets for PrimaryKeyRelatedField instances in TaskCreateSerializer.

**READY FOR FRONTEND DEVELOPMENT:**
All backend APIs are now available for frontend integration. The next phase focuses on building React components, pages, and user interfaces to consume these APIs.

- Complete each step fully before moving to the next
- Update progress tracking immediately after completing tasks
- Test thoroughly at each step
- Handle all error scenarios
- Use proper TypeScript typing throughout
- Implement proper validation on both frontend and backend

### **DON'Ts:**

- Skip steps or try to implement multiple modules simultaneously
- Move to frontend before backend is complete

- Use any shortcuts that compromise code quality
- Ignore error handling
- Skip documentation updates

### **Emergency Protocols:**
