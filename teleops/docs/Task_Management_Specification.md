# Teleops Task Management Specification

## Overview

The Task Management module handles work assignment and execution for dismantling projects. This module supports both **single-site tasks** (2G, 3G) and **multi-site tasks** (MW far-end/near-end coordination), implementing a **task-centric architecture** where tasks drive workflow and sites provide metadata context.

---

## Business Context

### Task Architecture

```yaml
Task Definition:
  - Work unit referencing one or more sites for dismantling
  - Created manually by Client/Independent Vendor from projects with completed inventory
  - Assigned to teams for execution
  - Tracked through status workflow until completion

Multi-Site Support:
  MW Projects:
    - Task references 2 sites: Far-end (Site A) + Near-end (Site B)
    - Coordinated dismantling across both locations
    - Single task progress tracking for entire work unit
    - Sites remain independent metadata containers

  2G/3G Projects:
    - Task references 1 site: Single location dismantling
    - Standard workflow and progress tracking
    - Site remains independent metadata container

Site-Task Relationship Architecture:
  - Tasks REFERENCE sites (do not contain them)
  - Sites are pure metadata containers (location, access info)
  - Sites have no operational status or assignment tracking
  - Sites are created once and referenced by multiple tasks
  - Task status is tracked at task level, not site level

Task Lifecycle: 1. Project Creation and Design (equipment types defined)
  2. Site Association (sites added to project)
  3. Inventory Management (equipment quantities allocated to project sites)
  4. Task Creation (Client/Independent Vendor creates task from project, selects sites)
  5. Team Assignment (Vendor assigns team to task)
  6. Assignment Acceptance (team accepts the task)
  7. Work Execution (on-site activities)
  8. Progress Tracking (task-level completion)
  9. Task Completion (all required work completed)
  10. Quality Review & Closure
```

### Integration with Existing Modules

```yaml
Project Integration:
  - Tasks created manually from projects with completed inventory
  - Equipment requirements inherited from project site inventory
  - Project context (client, customer, circle) carried forward

Site Integration:
  - Task creation includes site selection from project sites
  - Tasks reference sites through task-site relationship table
  - Sites provide location metadata and access information
  - Multi-site tasks coordinate work across referenced locations
  - Sites remain pure metadata containers (no operational state)
  - Site master data is independent of task lifecycle
  - Multiple tasks can reference the same site at different times

Inventory Integration:
  - Task equipment requirements inherited from project site inventory
  - Site-specific equipment allocations provide work context
  - Serial number tracking and verification at task level

Team Integration:
  - Tasks assigned to teams (not individual users)
  - Team-based access control and notifications
  - Assignment transfer capabilities between teams
```

  - All operational and workflow fields

Architectural Benefits:
  - Clear separation of concerns
  - Sites reusable across multiple tasks
  - Site metadata independent of task lifecycle
  - Task progress tracked at appropriate level
  - No data duplication between sites and tasks

MW Task Example:
  Task ID: 1001
  References:
    - Site A (ID: 501): site_role=Far_End, sequence_order=1
    - Site B (ID: 502): site_role=Near_End, sequence_order=2
  Progress: Single task-level progress (0-100%)
  Site Data: Fetched from sites table when needed

2G/3G Task Example:
  Task ID: 1002
  References:
    - Site C (ID: 503): site_role=Primary, sequence_order=1
  Progress: Single task-level progress (0-100%)
  Site Data: Fetched from sites table when needed
```

### Task Assignment System

```yaml
Assignment Model:

Assignment Transfer:
  - Original assignment marked as 'Transferred'
  - New assignment created with transfer_reason
  - Audit trail maintained for accountability
  - Team notifications for both old and new teams
```

---

## Task Status Workflow

### Status Definitions

```yaml
ALLOCATED:
  - Task manually created by Client/Independent Vendor from project
  - Client/vendor selected specific sites from project for this task
  - Contains all site details, project context, and planned inventory from selected sites
  - No team assigned yet (assigned_team_id = NULL)
  - Awaiting vendor to assign team

ASSIGNING:
  - Vendor has assigned task to a team
  - Team notified and can view all task details
  - Team can accept or request reassignment
  - Timeout mechanism for unaccepted assignments

ASSIGNED:
  - Team has accepted the task assignment
  - Team can view all task details:
    * Site information and locations (from site master data)
    * Project details and context
    * Planned inventory and equipment (from project site inventory)
    * Work instructions and requirements
  - Pre-work planning and preparation phase
  - Ready to start on-site work

WIP (Work In Progress):
  - Team has started on-site work
  - Progress tracking and regular updates
  - Work happening at any of the task's sites
  - Team updates progress based on current location

DONE:
  - All required work completed successfully
  - Quality checks passed
  - Documentation submitted and approved

PARTIALLY_DONE:
  - Some work completed, other work incomplete
  - Used for tasks requiring partial completion tracking
  - Requires follow-up action plan

IN_ISSUE:
  - Task encountered problems requiring intervention
  - Work may be paused pending resolution
  - Escalation to management required

DEALLOCATED:
  - Task removed from team assignment
  - Work discontinued or cancelled
  - Inventory and resources released
```

### Status Transitions

```yaml
Valid Transitions: ALLOCATED ‚Üí ASSIGNING (task assigned to team)
  ASSIGNING ‚Üí ASSIGNED (team accepts assignment)
  ASSIGNING ‚Üí ALLOCATED (assignment rejected/timeout)
  ASSIGNED ‚Üí WIP (work starts)
  WIP ‚Üí DONE (all work completed)
  WIP ‚Üí PARTIALLY_DONE (partial completion)
  WIP ‚Üí IN_ISSUE (problems encountered)
  PARTIALLY_DONE ‚Üí WIP (resuming incomplete work)
  PARTIALLY_DONE ‚Üí DONE (completing remaining work)
  IN_ISSUE ‚Üí WIP (issues resolved, work resumes)
  IN_ISSUE ‚Üí DEALLOCATED (task cancelled due to issues)
  Any Status ‚Üí DEALLOCATED (administrative cancellation)

Progress Management:
  - Task progress updated directly (no site-level aggregation)
  - Mobile app updates task progress based on current location
  - Progress reflects overall completion of work requirements
  - Sites provide context for where work is happening
```

---

## Multi-Site Task Coordination

### MW Project Task Structure

```yaml
MW Dismantling Task Components:
  Task Level (Work Unit):
    - Overall task coordination and management
    - Single progress tracking (0-100%)
    - Single status (WIP means work happening at any site)
    - Team assignment and scheduling
    - Equipment requirements across all sites

  Site A (Far-End Metadata):
    - Location data: coordinates, access instructions
    - Equipment allocation: what equipment is at this site
    - Work context: site-specific requirements
    - NO progress tracking, NO status fields

  Site B (Near-End Metadata):
    - Location data: coordinates, access instructions
    - Equipment allocation: what equipment is at this site
    - Work context: site-specific requirements
    - NO progress tracking, NO status fields

  Coordination Approach:
    - Team manages work sequence across sites
    - Task progress reflects overall completion
    - Sites provide location context and equipment data
    - Mobile app filters equipment by current location
```

### Work Coordination Workflow

```yaml
Multi-Site Work Coordination:
  Step 1: Task Assignment
    - Entire MW task assigned to single team
    - Team responsible for coordinating work across sites
    - Unified assignment and acceptance process

  Step 2: Work Planning
    - Team plans work sequence across sites
    - Uses site metadata for planning (location, equipment)
    - Determines resource allocation strategy

  Step 3: Mobile Execution
    - Team opens task in mobile app
    - Selects current location (Site A or Site B)
    - App filters equipment/work by current site
    - Updates task progress based on work completed

  Step 4: Task Completion
    - All required work completed across all sites
    - Task marked as DONE (single completion event)
    - Quality review covers entire task scope
```

## Equipment Verification Workflow (VLT-Style)

### Equipment Verification Data Structure

```yaml
Task Equipment Verification:
  - Equipment inherited from project design (categories and models)
  - Site-specific equipment allocations from project inventory
  - Category-organized verification workflow
  - VLT-compatible verification states and workflow

Equipment Verification Record:
  - task_id: bigint (reference to task)
  - site_id: bigint (reference to site within task)
  - equipment_category: string (CABINET, CARDS, DXU, PSU, etc.)
  - equipment_model: string (specific model within category)
  - planned_serial_number: string (optional - from project inventory)
  - verification_status: enum (Not_Started, In_Progress, Completed)
  - is_found: boolean (null = not verified, true = found, false = not found)
  - actual_serial_number: string (found equipment serial number)
  - serial_number_match: boolean (planned vs actual serial comparison)
  - not_found_reason: string (reason if equipment not found)
  - condition_assessment: string (physical condition of found equipment)
  - verification_notes: text (additional notes)
  - verified_by: integer (team member who verified)
  - verified_at: timestamp (verification timestamp)
  - gps_coordinates: point (GPS location of verification)
  - verification_photos: array (photos with GPS metadata)
```

### Equipment Categories and Models (VLT-Based)

```yaml
Equipment Category Structure:
  CABINET:
    - Models: [RBS-2964, RBS-2954, RBS-2204, RBS-2202, RBS-2106, RBS-2101]

    - Verification Priority: Medium

  OTHER:
    - Models: [Custom models from project design]
    - Serial Required: Configurable
    - Verification Priority: Low
```

### Equipment Verification Workflow

```yaml
Verification Process:
  Step 1: Equipment Discovery
    - Mobile app displays category-organized equipment checklist
    - Equipment items inherited from project design and inventory
    - Site-specific equipment allocations
    - Equipment grouped by tenant-created category for systematic verification

  Step 2: Equipment Verification
    - Found/Not Found selection (mandatory)
    - Serial number entry (if found and required)
    - Serial number matching validation
    - Condition assessment (if found)
    - GPS location capture
    - Photo documentation with GPS metadata

  Step 3: Not Found Handling
    - Select reason from predefined list:
      * "Not Found" - Equipment completely missing
      * "Used by BSS" - Equipment in use by base station
      * "Engaged with other Technology" - Equipment repurposed
      * "Post RFI" - Equipment status pending RFI response
      * "Others" - Custom reason with text input
    - Additional notes and documentation

  Step 4: Verification Completion
    - Equipment verification status updated
    - Task progress calculation
    - Offline sync capability
    - Real-time progress updates
```

### Equipment Verification States

```yaml
Equipment Verification States:
  Not_Started:
    - Equipment not yet verified
    - Initial state for all equipment
    - Verification can begin

  In_Progress:
    - Equipment verification started
    - Partial information entered
    - Verification can be completed later

  Completed:
    - Equipment verification finished
    - All required information provided
    - Contributes to task completion

Equipment Found/Not Found Logic:
  Found Equipment:
    - is_found = true
    - Serial number verification (if required)
    - Condition assessment
    - GPS location and photos
    - Verification notes

  Not Found Equipment:
    - is_found = false
    - Select not found reason
    - Additional notes
    - GPS location of search area
    - Photos of search area (optional)
    - Does not block task completion

  Not Verified:
    - is_found = null
    - Equipment not yet checked
    - Verification pending
    - Blocks task completion if required
```

### Serial Number Verification

```yaml
Serial Number Workflow:
  Serial Number Required:
    - Tenant-configured categories with mandatory serial verification
    - Tenant determines which categories require serial numbers
    - Verification blocked until serial entered

  Serial Number Optional:
    - Tenant-configured categories with optional serial verification
    - Tenant determines which categories allow optional serials
    - Verification allowed without serial

  Serial Number Not Required:
    - Tenant-configured categories without serial verification
    - Tenant determines which categories need no serial numbers
    - Verification based on Found/Not Found only

  Serial Number Matching:
    - Compare planned vs actual serial numbers
    - Exact match validation
    - Mismatch flagging and reporting
    - Corrected serial number capture
```

### GPS Photo Tagging

```yaml
GPS Photo Requirements:
  Mandatory GPS Tagging:
    - All equipment verification photos must include GPS coordinates
    - GPS location captured at time of photo
    - Location accuracy validation
    - GPS metadata embedded in photo

  Photo Types:
    - Equipment found photos (with GPS)
    - Equipment condition photos (with GPS)
    - Site overview photos (with GPS)
    - Not found area photos (with GPS)

  GPS Data Structure:
    - latitude: decimal degrees
    - longitude: decimal degrees
    - accuracy: meters
    - timestamp: UTC timestamp
    - altitude: meters (optional)

  GPS Validation:
    - Minimum accuracy threshold
    - Location within expected site boundary
    - GPS signal strength validation
    - Offline GPS caching capability
```

### Mobile App Equipment Verification

```yaml
Mobile Equipment Verification Interface:
  Category-Based Organization:
    - Equipment organized by tenant-created category (e.g., CABINET, ANTENNA, RADIO, etc.)
    - Tenant-configured category-specific verification requirements
    - Model selection within tenant categories
    - Progress tracking per tenant category

  Verification Workflow: 1. Select equipment category
    2. Select specific model within category
    3. Mark as Found/Not Found
    4. Enter serial number (if required and found)
    5. Assess condition (if found)
    6. Take GPS-tagged photos
    7. Add verification notes
    8. Submit verification

  Offline Capability:
    - Equipment verification data cached locally
    - Photo storage with GPS metadata
    - Progress tracking offline
    - Auto-sync when connectivity restored
    - Conflict resolution for concurrent edits

  Real-Time Sync:
    - Verification status updates
    - Progress synchronization
    - Team collaboration features
    - Conflict detection and resolution
```

### Equipment Verification Conflict Resolution

```yaml
Conflict Resolution Logic:
  Team Member Conflicts:
    - Same task, different team members verify same equipment
    - Latest timestamp wins (as per VLT logic)
    - Previous verification overwritten
    - Activity log maintained for audit

  Offline Sync Conflicts:
    - Equipment verified offline by multiple team members
    - Server-side conflict detection
    - Latest verification timestamp priority
    - Conflict notification to team
    - Audit trail preservation

  Equipment State Conflicts:
    - Equipment marked as both found and not found
    - Serial number conflicts (different actuals)
    - Photo conflicts (different GPS locations)
    - Resolution based on most recent verification
```

### Task Completion Logic (VLT-Compatible)

```yaml
Task Completion Calculation:
  Equipment Verification Impact:
    - Found equipment: Counts toward completion
    - Not found equipment: Does not block completion
    - Not verified equipment: Blocks completion

  Progress Calculation:
    - Total equipment items in task
    - Verified equipment count (found + not found)
    - Progress percentage = (verified / total) * 100
    - Task can be marked DONE by any team member

  Completion Requirements:
    - No minimum percentage required
    - All equipment verified (found or not found)
    - No blocking on not found equipment
    - Team member can mark task as DONE at any time

  VLT-Compatible Logic:
    - "Not Found" equipment does not impact task completion
    - Task completion independent of equipment found percentage
    - Focus on verification completeness, not equipment recovery
    - Team-based completion authority
```

    return taskDetails.sites.every((site) => site.individual_status === "Completed");

}, [taskDetails?.sites]);

useEffect(() => {
loadTaskDetails();
}, [loadTaskDetails]);

return {
taskDetails,
loading,
overallProgress,
allSitesCompleted,
updateSiteProgress,
completeSite,
loadTaskDetails,
};
};

## Conclusion

This Task Management specification provides a comprehensive framework for handling both single-site and multi-site dismantling tasks while maintaining backward compatibility with the existing VLT system. The multi-site MW functionality addresses the critical business need for coordinated Far-End/Near-End dismantling while preserving the proven workflow for 2G/3G single-site tasks.

Key benefits of this implementation:

1. **Unified Task Management**: Single interface for all task types
2. **Multi-Site Coordination**: Proper MW task handling with individual site progress
3. **Backward Compatibility**: Seamless migration from existing site-based workflow
4. **Scalable Architecture**: Supports future task types and coordination scenarios
5. **Enhanced Visibility**: Better progress tracking and reporting across all task types

The phased implementation approach ensures minimal disruption to current operations while progressively introducing advanced multi-site capabilities.

## Task Creation Workflow

### Manual Task Creation from Project

```yaml
Prerequisites for Task Creation:
  1. Project exists with appropriate type (Dismantle/Other)
  2. [If Dismantle] Project design is completed and approved
  3. Sites are associated with project (in project_sites table)
  4. [If Dismantle] Project inventory is allocated to sites
  5. User has permission to create tasks for the project

Task Creation Process:
  Step 1: Project Validation
    - Verify project exists and user has access
    - Check design approval (for dismantling projects)
    - Validate inventory completion (for dismantling projects)
    - Ensure sites are available for task creation

  Step 2: Site Selection
    - User selects which sites from project to include in task
    - System validates selected sites exist in project
    - If site missing from master data: automatically add to master data
    - If site missing from project: automatically add to project
    - Creates task-site relationships

  Step 3: Task Configuration
    - User provides task name (optional, auto-generated if not provided)
    - User sets priority and estimated duration
    - System determines task type based on site count and project characteristics
    - System inherits project context (client, customer, activity)

  Step 4: Inventory Inheritance
    - Task automatically inherits planned inventory from selected project sites
    - Equipment allocations become task equipment requirements
    - Serial number assignments preserved from project inventory
    - Site-specific equipment context maintained

  Step 5: Task Creation
    - Create task record with ALLOCATED status
    - Create task-site relationships with appropriate roles
    - Log task creation event
    - Task ready for team assignment
```

### Site Selection Logic

```yaml
Site Selection Rules:
  Available Sites:
    - Must exist in project's associated sites (project_sites table)
    - Must be accessible within user's tenant
    - Can be selected individually or in groups

  Site Validation Process:
    - Check if site exists in site master data
    - If missing from master data: create site record
    - Check if site is associated with project
    - If missing from project: add to project_sites
    - Validate site has inventory (for dismantling projects)

  Multi-Site Task Rules:
    - MW tasks require exactly 2 sites for Far_End/Near_End roles
    - Single-site tasks can have 1 site with Primary role
    - 3+ sites create single-site tasks with Primary roles

Site Role Assignment:
  Single-Site Tasks:
    - All sites get "Primary" role
    - Sequential ordering if multiple sites

  MW Multi-Site Tasks:
    - First site: "Far_End" role
    - Second site: "Near_End" role
    - If not exactly 2 sites: all get "Primary" role
```

### Inventory Inheritance Process

```yaml
Equipment Inheritance Rules:
  Source: Project Site Equipment Allocations
    - From project_site_equipment_allocations table
    - Only for sites selected in task creation
    - Includes quantities, serial numbers, specifications

  Task Equipment Requirements:
    - Equipment allocated to selected sites becomes task requirements
    - Serial number assignments preserved
    - Equipment specifications maintained
    - Site-specific equipment context retained

  Inventory Data Flow: Project Design ‚Üí Equipment Types Selected
    Project Inventory ‚Üí Quantities/Serials Allocated to Sites
    Task Creation ‚Üí Inherit Inventory from Selected Sites
    Task Execution ‚Üí Work with Inherited Equipment List

Equipment Context in Tasks:
  Site-Specific Equipment:
    - Task shows which equipment is at which site
    - Mobile app can filter equipment by current location
    - Team can verify equipment at specific sites
    - Progress tracking per site equipment

  Equipment Verification:
    - Serial number verification against task requirements
    - Equipment condition documentation
    - Site-specific equipment photos and notes
    - Completion tracking per equipment item
```
