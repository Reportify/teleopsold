## Executive Summary

### Project Overview

The Task Management System transforms the current site-based workflow into a flexible, sub-activity-driven architecture that supports:

- **Activity-specific workflows** (2G Dismantle, MW Dismantle, Installation & Commissioning, etc.)
- **Sub-activity allocation and assignment** with dual-path workflows
- **Progressive assignment capabilities** for phased project execution
- **Multi-site coordination** for MW and complex projects
- **Vendor and internal team management** with clear separation of concerns

### Key Business Benefits

1. **Operational Flexibility**: Support for any telecom activity workflow
2. **Resource Optimization**: Efficient allocation between vendors and internal teams
3. **Phased Execution**: Assign resources as projects progress
4. **Scalable Architecture**: Easy addition of new activities and workflows
5. **Clear Accountability**: Distinct allocation and assignment processes

### Implementation Timeline

- **Phase 1**: Core Framework & 2G Dismantle (Months 1-3)
- **Phase 2**: MW Dismantle & Multi-Site Support (Months 4-5)
- **Phase 3**: Installation & Commissioning Activities (Months 6-8)
- **Phase 4**: Advanced Features & Optimization (Months 9-12)

## System Architecture Overview

### Core Architecture Principles

#### 1. Activity-Driven Design

```yaml
Architecture Concept:
  - Tasks are containers for sub-activities
  - Each sub-activity represents specific work (Dismantle, Packaging, Transportation)
  - Sub-activities can be allocated/assigned independently
  - Execution follows dependency order, assignment is flexible
```

#### 2. Dual-Path Assignment Model

```yaml
External Vendor Path: UNALLOCATED → ALLOCATED → ASSIGNING → ASSIGNED
  (Tenant → Vendor → Team → Work)

Internal Team Path: UNALLOCATED → ASSIGNING → ASSIGNED
  (Tenant → Team → Work)
```

#### 3. Progressive Assignment Capability

```yaml
Assignment Flexibility:
  - Sub-activities can be assigned at task creation
  - Sub-activities can be left unassigned for later decision
  - Assignment independent of execution dependencies
  - Supports phased project execution strategies
```

### System Components

#### Core Framework

- **Activity Configuration System**: Defines available activities and their requirements
- **Workflow Execution Engine**: Manages sub-activity dependencies and execution order
- **Assignment Management**: Handles allocation to vendors and assignment to teams
- **Progress Tracking**: Monitors completion across all sub-activities

#### Activity Modules

- **2G Dismantle**: Single-site dismantling workflow
- **MW Dismantle**: Multi-site dismantling with coordination
- **Installation & Commissioning**: Equipment installation and system commissioning
- **Extensible Framework**: Easy addition of new activities

---

## Core Concepts & Terminology

### Key Definitions

#### Task

- **Definition**: A work container representing a complete scope of work for a project
- **Composition**: Contains multiple sub-activities that together complete the work
- **Examples**: "2G Site Dismantling", "MW Link Installation", "L900 Commissioning"

#### Sub-Activity

- **Definition**: Individual work unit within a task that can be allocated/assigned independently
- **Characteristics**: Has specific activity type, dependencies, and resource requirements
- **Examples**: "Dismantle", "Packaging", "Transportation", "RF Survey"

#### Allocation

- **Definition**: Tenant assigns sub-activity to external vendor
- **Process**: Vendor receives allocated work and must assign to their internal teams
- **Responsibility**: Vendor manages internal resource allocation

#### Assignment

- **Definition**: Direct assignment of sub-activity to a team (internal or by vendor)
- **Process**: Team receives assignment and can accept/reject
- **Responsibility**: Team executes the work when dependencies are met

#### Activity Type

- **Definition**: Standardized work category with specific requirements and workflows
- **Examples**: DISMANTLE, PACKAGING, TRANSPORTATION, RF_SURVEY, INSTALLATION
- **Configuration**: Each activity type has defined UI, mobile workflows, and completion criteria

### Status Definitions

#### Sub-Activity Status Flow

```yaml
UNALLOCATED:
  - Initial state for all sub-activities
  - No vendor or team assigned
  - Tenant decision pending

ALLOCATED:
  - Assigned to external vendor
  - Vendor must assign to internal team
  - Vendor-managed resource allocation

ASSIGNING:
  - Team assignment made (by vendor or tenant)
  - Team notification sent
  - Waiting for team acceptance

ASSIGNED:
  - Team has accepted assignment
  - Ready for execution when dependencies met
  - Active work assignment in place

IN_PROGRESS:
  - Team actively working on sub-activity
  - Progress tracking active
  - Work execution happening

COMPLETED:
  - Sub-activity work finished
  - Deliverables submitted and approved
  - Enables dependent sub-activities
```
